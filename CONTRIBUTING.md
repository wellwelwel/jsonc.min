## Developing

### Environment

You will need these tools installed on your system:

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (optional)
- [**Deno**](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) (optional)

> **Bun**, **Deno** and **Node.js** versions are tested using **Docker** official images.

---

Fork this project, download your forked repository locally and create a new branch from `main`.
Then run `npm ci` to clean install the node modules.

> Please, do not change the _package-lock.json_.

### Fixes

Where possible, provide an error test case that the fix covers.

### Features

It's better to discuss an **API** before actually start implementing it. You can open an [**Issue on Github**](https://github.com/wellwelwel/jsonc.min/issues/new), so we can discuss the **API** design implementation ideas.

> Please ensure test cases to cover new features.

npm run test:node

deno task test:deno

Also, run `npm run build` to compile and run _E2E_ tests in the virtual browser.
